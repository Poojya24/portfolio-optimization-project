# Portfolio Optimization Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a portfolio optimization project based on mean-variance theory and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathered closing prices for 10 risky assets from the market over a 3-month period.

2. **Returns Calculation:** Calculated the simple returns for the selected assets based on their closing prices.

3. **Mean-Variance Optimization:** Applied mean-variance theory to construct the Markowitz efficient frontier.

4. **CAPM Analysis:** Utilized a risk-free asset and the 10 risky assets to derive the Capital Market Line (CAPM). Determined the market portfolio by identifying the tangent point on the efficient frontier.

5. **Security Market Lines (SML):** Explored three different Security Market Lines using subsets of the 10 risky assets.
